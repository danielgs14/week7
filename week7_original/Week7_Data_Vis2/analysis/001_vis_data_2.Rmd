# Introduction
Here we will explore how to create publication-quality figures in R. To acknowledge my forebears, part of these materials comes from Brett Favaro's R course as well as from a "Wrangling Your Data in R" course taught by Drs. Sean Anderson, Franz Simon, and Alex Chubaty, and latter compiled for a "Visualization in R" workshop by Dra. Natascia Tamburello.

And always remember...

"Make 100 figures for every 1 you publish" -Marc Mangel

This time we will work with different types of data, first, we'll simulate some data to play with and explore how to customize the basic scatter plot. Then we will be loading a perch dataset should be loaded into memory. This dataset is comprised of 7328 obs of 5 vars

Data are from: http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/data-html/YPerchTL.html
obtained 23 Oct 2019

Data variables of perch dataset:
 sampledate: Date of capture
 gearid: Capture gear type â€“ beach seine (BSEINE), crayfish trap (CRAYTR), electrofishing (ELFISH), fyke net (FYKNET), trammel net (TRAMML), vertical gillnets of different mesh sizes (VBN0XX), and different types of fyke nets (FYKNED and FYKNEL)
 length: Total Length (nearest mm) at capture
 weight: Weight (nearest 0.1 or 1 g) at capture

# Install required packages
```{r, message=FALSE}
# If you don't yet have tidyverse run:
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

# We will require this package to handle some dates in this dataset
# install.packages("lubridate")
library(lubridate)

# We will use this package to load premade ggplot themes (more below)
# install.packages("ggthemes")
library(ggthemes)

# We will use this one to do multipanel plots 
# install.packages("gridExtra")
library(gridExtra)

#This one is to explore some extra color options
# install.packages("RColorBrewer")
library(RColorBrewer)

#Lastly to add labels to subfigures
# install.packages("egg")
library(egg)
```

# Additional capabilities in Base plot:
```{r}
# First, we'll simulate some data to play with

x <- seq(0, 20, by=0.1)
y1 <- rnorm(length(x), mean = x, sd = 3)
y2 <- rnorm(length(x), mean = x+12, sd = 3)
y3 <- 20 - y1
d <- data.frame(x, y1)
fit.y1 <- lm(y1~x, data = d)

plot(x, y1)
points(x, y2) #overlays points onto existing plot
abline (fit.y1) #Draws a line based on intercept/slope of a model fitted to the data
abline (v=5) #Draws a straight lines to mark mean or other "landmark", h = (horiz), v = (vert)
segments(5, 10, 15, 15) #for adding line segments by start and end point (x0, y0, x1, y1,)
lines(x, y1) #connects all the dots with straight lines, e.g., to visualize fluctuations in time series data

```

# Load, check & clean data
```{r}
perch <- read.csv("/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/IIO-UABC/Cursos/FCM/Analisis_R/Posgrado/wk7/Week7_Data_Vis2/data/YPerchTL.csv")

# To make things faster just run these lines:
perch$sampledate <- mdy(perch$sampledate)

perch <- perch %>%
  select(-lakeid) %>%
  select(-spname) %>% 
  select(-year4) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(sampledate))

# We just assigned as data 'sampledate' and removed unnecessary columns
# STEP 1, did it load correctly?
head(perch)

# STEP 2: Are the data types right?
sapply(perch, class)

# STEP 3: Check for missing or impossible values
range(perch$sampledate)

range(perch$year)

range(perch$length)
plot(perch$length)
hist(perch$length)

range(perch$weight)
# here there are tons of NAs that make this function's output not make much sense
range(perch$weight, na.rm = T) # Solve using 'na.rm'
plot(perch$weight)
hist(perch$weight)

# STEP 4: Factor levels
levels(perch$gearid)

# Seems allright
```

# Continuous X vs Continuous Y in Base plot
```{r}
plot(weight ~ length, data=perch)

# 1. Fix labels

plot(weight ~ length, data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (g)")

# 2. Data density 

plot(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (g)") #oops, now X axis is wrong!

# One solution
plot(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (log mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (log g)")
 
# Another solution: make a manually specified X axis
# But don't do this...just use ggplot

# Problem: blank space

plot(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (log mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (log g)",
     xlim=c(1.4,2.5))

# 3. There are no easy way to change the theme in base
# But you can do stuff like add grid lines

plot(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (log mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (log g)",
     xlim=c(1.4,2.5))

grid(lty = 1) #sloppy.

# Solution: Draw a blank graph
# then add the grid
# THEN draw the points

plot(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (log mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (log g)",
     xlim=c(1.4,2.5),
     pch="") # Makes the plot blank

grid(lty = 1) 
points(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch)


# Show how you can make a blank plot then add a grid then add points

# 4. Overplotting not a problem (default character is open circle)
# But here's how to specify characters:

plot(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (log mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (log g)",
     xlim=c(1.4,2.5),
     pch=8) # pch specifies character types

grid(lty = 1) 
points(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch)

# 5. Final polish - expand axis labels sizes

plot(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (log mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (log g)",xlim=c(1.4,2.5),
     pch="",
     cex.axis=1.4,
     cex.lab=1.6) 

grid(lty = 1) 
points(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch)

# You can also add colors!

plot(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (log mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (log g)",xlim=c(1.4,2.5),
     pch="",
     cex.axis=1.4,
     cex.lab=1.6) 

grid(lty = 1) 
points(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch, 
       col = "red") # col changes the fill color of points

# Or combine different colors
plot(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (log mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (log g)",xlim=c(1.4,2.5),
     pch="",
     cex.axis=1.4,
     cex.lab=1.6) 

grid(lty = 1) 
points(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch, 
       col = "red", bg = "blue", pch = 24) # bg changes the fill color


# 6. Export

# START by defining the file name and its parameters
#tiff(filename = "./plots/Figure1_base.tiff",
#     width = 15, height = 10, units = "cm", 
#     res = 300,
#     compression ="lzw")

# Everything to do with the plot comes next
plot(log10(weight) ~ log10(length), data=perch,
     xlab = "Length (log mm)",
     ylab = "Weight (log g)",xlim=c(1.4,2.5),

# Continuous X vs Continuous Y in ggplot
```{r}

# What makes this not publication quality? 
# 1. Fix labels

a + labs(x = "Length (mm)", y = "Weight (g)")

# Maybe a bit too small still - get to that later
a <- a + labs(x = "Length (mm)", y = "Weight (g)") # lock in this new plot

# 2. Supose you want to equalize data density

a + scale_y_log10() # not good enough

a + scale_y_log10() + scale_x_log10() # great!

# Note about logs:
log(10) # R uses natural log by default
log10(10) # log10 uses... log10

# 2A) Fix the x scale
# Plotting in log space has left blank space on our plot
# Let's fix it!

a + scale_y_log10() + scale_x_log10(limits = c(25, 300)) 

# Better data density, but now we need more ticks!

a + scale_y_log10() +

  scale_x_log10(limits = c(25, 300),
                breaks= seq(from=25, to=300, by=75)) 

# 3) Change the background aesthetic

# If you want to get crazy there are a whole bunch more themes in the package `ggthemes`
# Within the theme function you can do all sorts of customization

a + theme_bw()

a + theme_dark()
a + theme_classic()

# For fun:

# https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/

a + theme_tufte()
a + theme_base()

a + theme_economist()
a + theme_wsj()
a + theme_fivethirtyeight()

a + theme_excel()

# 4) Deal with overplotting (i.e. too many data points overlapping)

# Since we're doing a different geom_point we have to remake the whole plot
a <- ggplot(data = perch, aes(x = length, y = weight)) +

#5. Final polish

# Axes labels could be a bit bigger

a + theme(axis.text = element_text(size=16),
        axis.title = element_text(size=18))

# Recap to this point:

# Code to make figure -

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A note here on colors on ggplot, 
# Besides cutomization you can do in ggplot, there are a bunch of color options to explore
# In particular there is a package that helps you assign way more colors than what ggplot offers:
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html

# Let's just quickly check these out
par(mar=c(3,4,2,2))
display.brewer.all()

# Also, ggplot has a nice color scale palette which is supposedly the best to better
# read your data, colorblind friendly and prints great on greyscale if needed when using
# sequencial colors, like for a gradient
# They are called the 'viridis' color palettes 
# https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html

# There are these color options ("magma" (or "A"), "inferno" (or "B"), 
# "plasma" (or "C"), "viridis" (or "D", the default option) and "cividis" (or "E").)
# You can use it like this:
d <- ggplot(data = perch, aes(x = length, y = weight)) +

#  scale_fill_viridis_() +
