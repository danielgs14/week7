Week 7: Displaying Data Visually 2

Background:
In week 7 of EDA-R we get into getting data display ready for publication.

We focus on axes, themes, data density, and outputting at publication quality.

We use some dataset again from Derek Ogle's website: http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/data-html/YPerchTL.html
